# Compliance-Coding-Audit-Simulation
Coding audit simulation integrating CAC/NLP validation, risk adjustment analysis, and EPIC audit trail modeling designed to advance HIM compliance strategy and HealthIT governance

## üß† Project Overview

This project simulates a multi-encounter audit focused on hematologic malignancies and stem cell disorders. It reflects real-world challenges in outpatient and inpatient coding, risk adjustment, and documentation compliance. The dataset includes nine encounters with layered discrepancies involving CAC/NLP attribution, MEAT linkage, modifier usage, and time-based coding errors.

All clinical notes and data are **mock/simulated** but modeled on authentic documentation structures and regulatory standards.

## üéØ Objectives

- Identify and analyze coding discrepancies that impact HCC risk scores  
- Evaluate documentation for MEAT criteria, modifier accuracy, and attestation validity  
- Simulate CAC/NLP attribution errors and override logic  
- Demonstrate HIM audit methodology aligned with RHIA competencies  
- Create a portfolio artifact suitable for compliance training and interview presentation

---

## üìä Dataset Components

- **9 full encounter notes** (see `/encounter-notes/`)  
- **Audit findings spreadsheet** with structured discrepancy tracking  
- **STAR story** explaining audit logic and impact  
- **Optional dashboard mockup** summarizing risk levels and coding attribution

---

## üîç Discrepancy Types Covered

- CAC/NLP misreads of genetic markers and historical diagnoses  
- Unsupported HCC coding due to missing MEAT  
- Time-based coding errors (missing counseling/coordination)  
- Split/shared and teaching physician modifier violations  
- Unsigned notes and missing attestations  
- Symptom-based coding misinterpreted as confirmed diagnoses

---

## üß¨ Diagnoses Simulated

- Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)  
- Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)  
- Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)  
- Fanconi Anemia  
- Diamond-Blackfan Anemia  
- Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH)  
- Essential Thrombocythemia  
- Dyskeratosis Congenita

## üìå Disclaimer

This project uses **simulated clinical documentation and mock data** for educational and portfolio purposes. All scenarios are fictional but reflect realistic encounter structures and audit logic based on ICD-10-CM guidelines, CMS risk adjustment policy, and HIM best practices.
